Automatic Eyeblink Artifact Removal from Single Channel EEG Signals using One-dimensional
Convolutional Denoising Autoencoder
• EEG Data Collection: Recording electrical activity from the scalp using electrodes placed in specific config-
urations.
• Filtering: Applying band-pass filters to remove noise and other unwanted frequencies from the raw EEG and
EOG signals.
• Dataset : Utilized a dataset consisting of 27,200 samples for training, 3,400 samples for validation, and 3,400
samples for testing, each with a sequence length of 512, to develop and train a autoencoder for EEG signal
enhancement.
• Proposed Model : Convolutional Denoising Autoencoder.
• Model evaluation : Achieved a mean MSE of 0.0621, a Relative Root Mean Square Error of 0.4448, and a
mean correlation coefficient of 0.8747.
